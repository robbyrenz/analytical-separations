\begin{abstract}
	Gas chromatography - electron ionization mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) was used to detect and quantify the amount of BDE-47 in fish oil. Initially, the mass spectrum and total ion chromatogram was obtained for the analyte in question, BDE-47, the internal standard PBB-77 and the recovery standard `2-\ce{HCH}. Afterwards, 2 samples of fish oil was prepared using solid-phase extraction. Finally, the fish samples, blanks, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH} underwent GC/EI-MS-SIM analysis, in which the ions being monitored were at a m/z of 326 and 486 for BDE-47, 470 and 310 for PBB-77, and 181 and 219 for `2-\ce{HCH}. Through calculations, it was realized that the average concentration of BDE-47 in the first sample of fish oil was \SI{1.47e-5}{\ug/g} \num{+-1.07}\%, while the second sample of fish oil had a BDE-47 concentration of \SI{1.66e-5}{\ug/g} \num{+-13.75}\%.

\section{Introduction}
Gas chromatography (GC) is a separation technique that analyzes volatile compounds \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. Consequently, this analysis can lead a lot of useful situations such as the determination of the purity of a compound or even quantifying individual components in mixtures \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. In GC, the analyte is volatilized and carried through the column by the mobile phase, often called the carrier gas \cite{harris}. This carrier gas can either be \ce{He} or \ce{H2} \cite{harris}. These gases are often chosen as the carrier gas as they are chemically inert and would therefore not react with the analytes \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of halogenated compounds that are commonly used as flame retardants \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. These compounds are an environmental health hazard as they have the potential to accumulate in the food chain \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. In addition, 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether, also known as BDE-47 \cite{rat}, is a PBDE congener, and has been found to cause neurotoxic effects in adults \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. Commonly used detection techniques for PBDEs are high-resolution mass spectrometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}.

LRMS is commonly done with selected ion monitoring (SIM) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. SIM increases the selectivity of mass spectrometry for analytes and reduces its response to everything else \cite{harris}. It does this by setting the mass spectrometer to detect just one or even a few m/z values \cite{harris}. One of the advantages of SIM is that the signal-to-noise ratio greatly increases as the mass spectrometer spends its entire analysis time measuring that particular ion, or a couple of ions \cite{harris}.

Internal standards are used for a number of reasons, such as when sample loss is expected during the sample preparation step, or when the response of the quantity of sample detected differs at each analysis \cite{harris}. Essentially, an internal standard is a known quantity of a compound that differs from the analyte, and is added to the mixture containing the analyte to be detected \cite{harris}. 

An injection mode of splitless rather than a split is used when attempting to analyze trace chemicals \cite{harris}. Furthermore, a splitless injection mode minimizes solvent tailing by opening the split vent after around \SI{1}{min} so that the any remaining sample in the injection port can be purged \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

The main objective of this entire experiment is to detect as well as quantify BDE-47 in a sample of fish oil. This is accomplished by making a method that utilizes a SIM.

\section{Chemicals, Methods and Instrumentation}

\subsection{Chemicals}
In the first week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, all of each were at a concentration of \SI{50}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as standard solutions. In the second week, fish oil (Exact Norwegian Cod Liver Oil), dichloromethane (emd, Lot 5Q160, CAS: 75-09-2) and PBB-77, at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as chemicals. Finally, in the last week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, each at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used. Throughout the entirety of the experiment, hexane (Caledon Laboratory Chemicals, CAS no. 110-54-3, LOT: 89001) and isooctane (OmniSolv, CAS: 540-84-1, LOT: 52054) were used.

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The separation and analysis of the entire experiment was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC, coupled with a 5975C inert XL EI/CI MSD with a triple axis detector. The dimensions of the column used was $30m \times 0.250mm \times 0.25\mu{}m$, by Agilent Technologies. The stationary phase was (5\%-Phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. Each analysis was performed with the injection mode at splitless, with \ce{He} as the carrier gas, and the flow rate was set at \SI{1}{mL/min}. The injection mode used for each analysis was splitless, and the injection volume was \SI{2}{\mu{}L} for each analysis.

\subsection{Methods}
In the first week of the experiment, a (normalized) full scan spectrum was obtained for BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}. The upper limit of the scan range was set to 30 \si{\amu} more than the molecular weight of the respective analyte that was being analyzed. For each analysis, the oven temperature was initially set to \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{5}{min}, then it was increased to \SI{280}{\degreeCelsius} at a rate of \SI{10}{\degreeCelsius/min}, and it was held at that temperature for \SI{7}{min}. Furthermore, the temperature of the splitless injection port was set to \SI{260}{\degreeCelsius}, the electron energy was set to \SI{70}{eV}, and the temperature of the GC-MSD interface was fixed at a temperature of \SI{280}{\degreeCelsius}.

In the second week of the experiment, two samples of fish oil were prepared by adding \SI{2}{\mu{}g/mL} of PBB-77 as the internal standard to the sample, and then having it undergo solid-phase extraction in order to extract lipids. Afterwards, the majority of the solvent was then removed from the sample through rotary evaporation.

In the last week of the experiment, a calibration solution was produced by adding each of BDE-47 and PBB-77, at a volume of \SI{10}{\mu{}L}, to a \SI{0.5}{mL} of isooctane contained in an auto sampler vial, and it was diluted all the way to \SI{1.0}{mL} with the solvent. \SI{50}{\mu{}L} of `2-\ce{HCH} was added to the calibration solution, while \SI{10}{\mu{}L} was added to the fish samples that was prepared last week. Finally, the GC-MS was set to scan only two ions per analyte, the parameters that was selected is shown in table \ref{tab-para}.

\subsection{Discussion}
\setcounter{figure}{23}
The mass spectra for the compounds BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH} shown in figures 3,4 and 5 respectively. And the identification of its corresponding molecular ion (M+) is illustrated in figures 24, 25 and 26, except that they have an extra positive charge in the molecule. Note that the figures were taken from the website PubChem [The PubChem Project. \\ https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (accessed Dec 11, 2018)].

Table \ref{tab-para} shows the mass of the ions that were chosen to be monitored. These ions were chosen as the peaks of those ions did not overlap with the chosen peaks of the other ions. In addition, the abundance of the peaks was adequately high. Refer to figures 3, 4 and 5 for more clarity.

The analysis of hexanes as blanks (figures 6 - 11) regarded that the contribution of BDE-47 is negligible, considering that at a retention time of around \SI{22.35}{min}, the abundance of the peak caused by BDE-47 is extremely low. So one can safely assume that the concentration of BDE-47 calculated was largely contributed to its presence in the oil of the fish.

As it can clearly be seen in table \ref{tab-mean}, the average concentration of BDE-47 in the very first sample of fish oil was \SI{1.47e-5}{\ug/g} \num{+-1.07}\%, and in the second sample, the concentration of BDE-47 was \SI{1.66e-5}{\ug/g} \num{+-13.75}\%. Also, as evidenced in table \ref{tab-sn}, the average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio during the analysis of the first fish oil sample was \num{93.65}, and it was \num{7.27} in the second analysis. This can be concluded that since the value of the S/N ratio for the second sample it not quite high, compared to the first sample, this experiment can be repeated multiple times until a reasonable value is obtained. This statement goes double when the standard deviation of the concentration of BDE-47 is also taken into account; its value is much higher than the first sample of fish oil.
