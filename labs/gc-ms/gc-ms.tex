\section{Introduction}
Gas chromatography (GC) is a separation technique that analyzes volatile compounds \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. Consequently, this analysis can lead a lot of useful situations such as the determination of the purity of a compound or even detecting explosives \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. In GC, the analyte is volatilized and carried through the column by the mobile phase, often called the carrier gas \cite{harris}. This carrier gas can either be \ce{He} or \ce{H2} \cite{harris}. These gases are often chosen as the carrier gas as they are chemically inert and would therefore not react with the analytes \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of halogenated compounds that are commonly used as flame retardants \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. These compounds are an environmental health hazard as they have the potential to accumulate in the food chain \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. In addition, BDE-47, a PBDE congener, has been found to cause neurotoxic effects in adults \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. Commonly used detection techniques for PBDEs are high-resolution mass spectrometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. LRMS is commonly done with selected ion monitoring (SIM) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. SIM increases the selectivity of mass spectrometry for analytes and reduces its response to everything else \cite{harris}.

The main objective of this experiment is to make a method that uses a SIM for quantitative analysis of PBDEs by GC-EI-LRMS.

\section{Chemicals, Methods and Instrumentation}

\subsection{Chemicals}
In the first week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, all of each were at a concentration of \SI{50}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as standard solutions. In the second week, fish oil (Exact Norwegian Cod Liver Oil), dichloromethane (emd, Lot 5Q160, CAS: 75-09-2) and PBB-77, at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as chemicals. Finally, in the last week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, each at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used. Throughout the entirety of the experiment, hexane (Caledon Laboratory Chemicals, CAS no. 110-54-3, LOT: 89001) and isooctane (OmniSolv, CAS: 540-84-1, LOT: 52054) were used.

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The separation and analysis of the entire experiment was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC, coupled with a 5975C inert XL EI/CI MSD with a triple axis detector. The dimensions of the column used was $30m \times 0.250mm \times 0.25\mu{}m$, by Agilent Technologies. The stationary phase was (5\%-Phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. Each analysis was performed with the injection mode at splitless, with \ce{He} as the carrier gas, and the flow rate was set at \SI{1}{mL/min}. Do I need to state the pressure and volume and splitless?

\subsection{Calculations}

\begin{description}
	\item[Calculating the capacity factor of chlorobenzene for figure 2 of the chromatogram] \hfill \\
		\begin{equation} \label{equ-capacity-factor}
			\begin{split}
				K & = \frac{t_r - t_m}{t_m} \\
				K & = \frac{2.343 - 1.438}{1.438} \\
				K & = \frac{0.905}{1.438} \\
				K & = 0.629346 \approx 0.629
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Equation \ref{equ-capacity-factor} was taken from \cite{harris}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Chromatograms}
There are ? sheets of GC-MS chromatograms.
