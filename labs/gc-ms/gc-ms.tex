\section{Introduction}
Gas chromatography (GC) is a separation technique that analyzes volatile compounds \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. Consequently, this analysis can lead a lot of useful situations such as the determination of the purity of a compound or even quantifying individual components in mixtures \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. In GC, the analyte is volatilized and carried through the column by the mobile phase, often called the carrier gas \cite{harris}. This carrier gas can either be \ce{He} or \ce{H2} \cite{harris}. These gases are often chosen as the carrier gas as they are chemically inert and would therefore not react with the analytes \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of halogenated compounds that are commonly used as flame retardants \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. These compounds are an environmental health hazard as they have the potential to accumulate in the food chain \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. In addition, 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether, also known as BDE-47 \cite{rat}, is a PBDE congener, and has been found to cause neurotoxic effects in adults \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. Commonly used detection techniques for PBDEs are high-resolution mass spectrometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}.

LRMS is commonly done with selected ion monitoring (SIM) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. SIM increases the selectivity of mass spectrometry for analytes and reduces its response to everything else \cite{harris}. It does this by setting the mass spectrometer to detect just one or even a few m/z values \cite{harris}. One of the advantages of SIM is that the signal-to-noise ratio greatly increases as the mass spectrometer spends its entire analysis time measuring that particular ion, or a couple of ions \cite{harris}.

Internal standards are used for a number of reasons, such as when sample loss is expected during the sample preparation step, or when the response of the quantity of sample detected differs at each analysis \cite{harris}. Essentially, an internal standard is a known quantity of a compound that differs from the analyte, and is added to the mixture containing the analyte to be detected \cite{harris}. 

A splitless injection mode is used for trace analysis. 

An injection mode of splitless rather than a split is used when attempting to analyze trace chemicals \cite{harris}. Furthermore, a splitless injection mode minimizes solvent tailing by opening the split vent after around \SI{1}{min} so that the any remaining sample in the injection port can be purged \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

The main objective of this entire experiment is to detect as well as quantify BDE-47 in a sample of fish oil. This is accomplished by making a method that utilizes a SIM.

\section{Chemicals, Methods and Instrumentation}

\subsection{Chemicals}
In the first week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, all of each were at a concentration of \SI{50}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as standard solutions. In the second week, fish oil (Exact Norwegian Cod Liver Oil), dichloromethane (emd, Lot 5Q160, CAS: 75-09-2) and PBB-77, at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as chemicals. Finally, in the last week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, each at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used. Throughout the entirety of the experiment, hexane (Caledon Laboratory Chemicals, CAS no. 110-54-3, LOT: 89001) and isooctane (OmniSolv, CAS: 540-84-1, LOT: 52054) were used.

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The separation and analysis of the entire experiment was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC, coupled with a 5975C inert XL EI/CI MSD with a triple axis detector. The dimensions of the column used was $30m \times 0.250mm \times 0.25\mu{}m$, by Agilent Technologies. The stationary phase was (5\%-Phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. Each analysis was performed with the injection mode at splitless, with \ce{He} as the carrier gas, and the flow rate was set at \SI{1}{mL/min}. The injection mode used for each analysis was splitless, and the injection volume was \SI{2}{\mu{}L} for each analysis.

\subsection{Methods}
In the first week of the experiment, a (normalized) full scan spectrum was obtained for BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}. The upper limit of the scan range was set to 30 \si{\amu} more than the molecular weight of the respective analyte that was being analyzed. For each analysis, the oven temperature was initially set to \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{5}{min}, then it was increased to \SI{280}{\degreeCelsius} at a rate of \SI{10}{\degreeCelsius/min}, and it was held at that temperature for \SI{7}{min}. Furthermore, the temperature of the splitless injection port was set to \SI{260}{\degreeCelsius}, the electron energy was set to \SI{70}{eV}, and the temperature of the GC-MSD interface was fixed at a temperature of \SI{280}{\degreeCelsius}.

In the second week of the experiment, two samples of fish oil were prepared by adding \SI{2}{\mu{}g/mL} of PBB-77 as the internal standard to the sample, and then having it undergo solid-phase extraction in order to extract lipids. Afterwards, the majority of the solvent was then removed from the sample through rotary evaporation.

In the last week of the experiment, a calibration solution was produced by adding each of BDE-47 and PBB-77, at a volume of \SI{10}{\mu{}L}, to a \SI{0.5}{mL} of isooctane contained in an auto sampler vial, and it was diluted all the way to \SI{1.0}{mL} with the solvent. \SI{50}{\mu{}L} of `2-\ce{HCH} was added to the calibration solution, while \SI{10}{\mu{}L} was added to the fish samples that was prepared last week. Finally, the GC-MS was set to scan only two ions per analyte, the parameters that was selected is shown in table \ref{tab-para}. Refer to table ref to see which 2 ions was monitored.

\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item maybe talk about the difference between internal standards and standard additions?
	\item maybe talk about LRMS?
	\item maybe talk about why we use splitless mode of injection rather than a split or even a on-column injection?
\end{itemize}
