\section{Introduction}
Gas chromatography (GC) is a separation technique that analyzes volatile compounds \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. Consequently, this analysis can lead a lot of useful situations such as the determination of the purity of a compound or even quantifying individual components in mixtures \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}. In GC, the analyte is volatilized and carried through the column by the mobile phase, often called the carrier gas \cite{harris}. This carrier gas can either be \ce{He} or \ce{H2} \cite{harris}. These gases are often chosen as the carrier gas as they are chemically inert and would therefore not react with the analytes \cite{vitha_chromatography:_2017}.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of halogenated compounds that are commonly used as flame retardants \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. These compounds are an environmental health hazard as they have the potential to accumulate in the food chain \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. In addition, 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether, also known as BDE-47 \cite{rat}, is a PBDE congener, and has been found to cause neurotoxic effects in adults \cite{thomsen_comparing_2002}. Commonly used detection techniques for PBDEs are high-resolution mass spectrometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}.

LRMS is commonly done with selected ion monitoring (SIM) \cite{bjorklund_mass_2003}. SIM increases the selectivity of mass spectrometry for analytes and reduces its response to everything else \cite{harris}. It does this by setting the mass spectrometer to detect just one or even a few m/z values \cite{harris}. One of the advantages of SIM is that the signal-to-noise ratio greatly increases as the mass spectrometer spends its entire analysis time measuring that particular ion, or a couple of ions \cite{harris}.

Internal standards are used for a number of reasons, such as when sample loss is expected during the sample preparation step, or when the response of the quantity of sample detected differs at each analysis \cite{harris}. Essentially, an internal standard is a known quantity of a compound that differs from the analyte, and is added to the mixture containing the analyte to be detected \cite{harris}. 

Injectors are awesome!

The main objective of this entire experiment is to detect as well as quantify BDE-47 in a sample of fish oil. This is accomplished by making a method that utilizes a SIM.

\section{Chemicals, Methods and Instrumentation}

\subsection{Chemicals}
In the first week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, all of each were at a concentration of \SI{50}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as standard solutions. In the second week, fish oil (Exact Norwegian Cod Liver Oil), dichloromethane (emd, Lot 5Q160, CAS: 75-09-2) and PBB-77, at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used as chemicals. Finally, in the last week, BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}, each at a concentration of \SI{10}{\mu{}g/mL} in isooctane, were used. Throughout the entirety of the experiment, hexane (Caledon Laboratory Chemicals, CAS no. 110-54-3, LOT: 89001) and isooctane (OmniSolv, CAS: 540-84-1, LOT: 52054) were used.

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The separation and analysis of the entire experiment was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC, coupled with a 5975C inert XL EI/CI MSD with a triple axis detector. The dimensions of the column used was $30m \times 0.250mm \times 0.25\mu{}m$, by Agilent Technologies. The stationary phase was (5\%-Phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. Each analysis was performed with the injection mode at splitless, with \ce{He} as the carrier gas, and the flow rate was set at \SI{1}{mL/min}. Do I need to state the pressure and volume and splitless?

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{tab-para} shows some cool stuff, and table \ref{tab-mass} shows the molecular weight of BDE-47, PBB-77 and `2-\ce{HCH}. Table \ref{tab-fish} shows the mass of fish oil that was weighed out for the experiment.

\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item maybe talk about the difference between internal standards and standard additions?
	\item maybe talk about LRMS?

\subsection{Calculations}


\begin{description}

	\item[Calculating the response factor] \hfill \\
		\begin{equation} \label{response-factor}
			\begin{split}
				\frac{\textit{Area of Analyte Signal}}{\textit{Concentration of Analyte}} & = F\Bigg(\frac{\textit{Area of Standard Signal}}{\textit{Concentration of Standard}}\Bigg) \\
				\frac{A_X}{[X]} & = F\Bigg(\frac{A_S}{[S]}\Bigg)
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Equation \ref{response-factor} was taken from \cite{harris}, where $[X]$ and $[S]$ represent the concentrations of analyte and of the standard, respectively.

	\item[Calculating the capacity factor of chlorobenzene for figure 2 of the chromatogram] \hfill \\
		\begin{equation} \label{equ-capacity-factor}
			\begin{split}
				K & = \frac{t_r - t_m}{t_m} \\
				K & = \frac{2.343 - 1.438}{1.438} \\
				K & = \frac{0.905}{1.438} \\
				K & = 0.629346 \approx 0.629
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Equation \ref{equ-capacity-factor} was taken from \cite{harris}.
