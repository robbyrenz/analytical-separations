# **Supercritical Fluid Chromatography**

## **What is supercritical fluid?**
- Its a phase that exists at only above a certain temperature, regardless of what the pressure is.
- Its density and viscosity are between those of gas and liquid.
- It has the ability to act as a solvent.
- An example of a supercritical fluid is SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), water, methanol, ammonia.

## **How does it work?**
- SFC with a mixture of CO2 and organic solvent is "green" technology that reduces organic solvent use by up to 90% for the separation of kilograms of compounds and enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry.
- The low viscosity of the supercritical fluid allows for faster flow, which consequently increases productivity.
- Although CO2 is a weak solvent, when mixed with some organic solvent, it is capable of dissolving a lot of compounds.

## **What are its feature?**
- It provides increased speed and resolution with regards to liquid chromatography.
- This is because of its higher diffusion coefficients of solutes in supercritical fluids.
- When pressure is released

------------------------------
- state about SFC columns.
- state that people probably moved to SFC from HPLC because of its speed and fast method development, and not necessarily because it is environmentally friendly.
- talk about how to increase elution strength, and compare it as to how you would do it in a GC and LC.
- talk about how you know that people prefer GC over LC, unless the solute is non-volatile, and state when would people really prefer SFC over GC.

# Blueprint of my Presentation
- Open up with a joke
- Explain what SFC is in a nutshell
    - Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC for short) is chromatography in which the mobile phase is a supercritical fluid.
    - In most circumstances, the mobile phase chosen is CO2.
    - SFC is extremely similar to high performance liquid chromatography, or HPLC for short, in terms of its equipment/instrumentation as well as the software used.
    - In fact, the hardware can be used to rapidly switch back and forth between SFC and either normal or reversed phase HPLC, in just a few minutes!
- Explain what a supercritical fluid is, and reference the graph
    - Its a phase that exists at only above a certain temperature, regardless of what the pressure is.
    - Its density and viscosity are between those of gas and liquid.
    - It has the ability to act as a solvent.
    - An example of a supercritical fluid is SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), water, methanol, ammonia.
    - Basically, it moves like a gas but dissolves like a liquid, think of it like that
- How does it work?
    - Explain the need for modifiers
        - They do stuff
    - Stationary phases for different circumstances
    - Reference the figure 2 in your handouts and presentation
        - CO2 in its vapour phase is supplied from a cylinder at room temperature
        - The SFC conversion module contains a chiller
            - it cools the incoming fluid and the pump head of the booster pump
        - it then moves to the binary pump section
            - in it, the CO2 and the modifier is mixed in a compartment called a mixer
            - essentially, the job of the mixer is to homogenize the two solvents
        - something
- Why should you care (As in, why use SFC and not just LC)?
    - remember that LC is preferred over GC when
        - one wants to analyze thermally unstable compounds
        - one wants to analyze non-volatile compounds
    - start off with the van Deemter equation
        - draw the equation on the board
            - A is Eddy diffusion
            - B is longitudinal diffusion
            - C is mass transfer
        - state that increased temperature and diffusion coefficient increases the B term, while increased viscosity decreases it
        - B is neglected in liquid chromatography because the mobile phase velocity is much higher than the diffusion coefficient of the component in solution.
    - However, in SFC, the B term is not negligible
        - the intermolecular interactions in gaseous CO2 are weak
        - when it is compressed, the resulting dense fluid acts like a solvent.
        - Yet, the intermolecular forces are still weak, despite the increased density.
        - So, other compounds dissolved in CO2 can diffuse rapidly through it.
