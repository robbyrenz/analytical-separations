# **Supercritical Fluid Chromatography**

## **What is supercritical fluid?**
- Its a phase that exists at only above a certain temperature, regardless of what the pressure is.
- Its density and viscosity are between those of gas and liquid.
- It has the ability to act as a solvent.
- An example of a supercritical fluid is SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), water, methanol, ammonia.

## **How does it work?**
- SFC with a mixture of CO2 and organic solvent is "green" technology that reduces organic solvent use by up to 90% for the separation of kilograms of compounds and enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry.
- The low viscosity of the supercritical fluid allows for faster flow, which consequently increases productivity.
- Although CO2 is a weak solvent, when mixed with some organic solvent, it is capable of dissolving a lot of compounds.

## **What are its feature?**
- It provides increased speed and resolution with regards to liquid chromatography.
- This is because of its higher diffusion coefficients of solutes in supercritical fluids.
- When pressure is released

------------------------------
- state about SFC columns.
- state that people probably moved to SFC from HPLC because of its speed and fast method development, and not necessarily because it is environmentally friendly.
- talk about how to increase elution strength, and compare it as to how you would do it in a GC and LC.
- talk about how you know that people prefer GC over LC, unless the solute is non-volatile, and state when would people really prefer SFC over GC.
