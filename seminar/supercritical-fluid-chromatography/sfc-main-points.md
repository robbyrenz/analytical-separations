# **Supercritical Fluid Chromatography**

## **What is supercritical fluid?**
- Its a phase that exists at only above a certain temperature, regardless of what the pressure is.
- Its density and viscosity are between those of gas and liquid.
- It has the ability to act as a solvent.
- An example of a supercritical fluid is SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), water, methanol, ammonia.

## **How does it work?**
- SFC with a mixture of CO2 and organic solvent is "green" technology that reduces organic solvent use by up to 90% for the separation of kilograms of compounds and enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry.
- The low viscosity of the supercritical fluid allows for faster flow, which consequently increases productivity.
- Although CO2 is a weak solvent, when mixed with some organic solvent, it is capable of dissolving a lot of compounds.

## **What are its feature?**
- It provides increased speed and resolution with regards to liquid chromatography.
- This is because of its higher diffusion coefficients of solutes in supercritical fluids.
- When pressure is released.

## Open up with a joke or two

## Explain what SFC is in a nutshell
- Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC for short) is chromatography in which the mobile phase is a supercritical fluid.
- In most circumstances, the mobile phase chosen is CO2.
- SFC is extremely similar to high performance liquid chromatography, or HPLC for short, in terms of its equipment/instrumentation as well as the software used.
- In fact, the hardware can be used to rapidly switch back and forth between SFC and either normal or reversed phase HPLC, in just a few minutes!

## Explain what a supercritical fluid is, and reference the graph
- Its a phase that exists at only above a certain temperature, regardless of what the pressure is.
- critical point is the temperature at which only a single phase can exist.
- However, it is not recognized as a separate state of matter
- Just means a liquid can be converted to a gas and vice-versa without a phase transition.
- However, the conditions used are subcritical.
- Its density and viscosity are between those of gas and liquid.
- It has the ability to act as a solvent.
- An example of a supercritical fluid is SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), water, methanol, ammonia.
- Basically, it moves like a gas but dissolves like a liquid, think of it like that

## How does it work?
- Explain the need for modifiers
    - major difference with SFC from HPLC is the fact that the mobile phase is a densed, compressed gas instead of a liquid.
    - At extremly high pressures greater than 80 bar, CO2 acts like a solvent.
    - CO2 is nonpolar solvent
    - So for more polar solutes, an organic modifier (cosolvent), mostly alcohol, is added to the mobile phase.
    - Gradient elution from low to high modifier concentration is the norm.
    - Peaks elute from lower to higher polarity.
    - However, for many highly polar solutes, interactions with stationary phase is too intense
    - Consequence: solutes fail to elute, or elute with poor peak shape
    - Solution: include a highly polar additive (strong acid or base) dissolved in the modifier.
- why CO2?
    - readily available
    - cheap
    - has an accessible critical point
    - relatively safe
    - green as it can be recycled
    - miscible with a wide range of highly polar modifiers
- Why use methanol as a cosolvent?
    - completely miscible with CO2
    - availability
    - inexpensiveness
    - relatively low toxic
- Stationary phases for different circumstances
    - for polar solutes
        - polar stationary phases are used bare silica or several ethylpyridines
    - for nonpolar solutes
        - reversed-phase columns such as C18, C8, C4 and methyl are used.
- Reference the figure 2 in your handouts and presentation
    - CO2 in its vapour phase is supplied from a cylinder at room temperature
    - The SFC conversion module contains a chiller
        - it cools the incoming fluid and the pump head of the booster pump
    - it then moves to the binary pump section
        - in it, the CO2 and the modifier is mixed in a compartment called a mixer
        - essentially, the job of the mixer is to homogenize the two solvents
- Because the mobile phase is a compressed gas, the backpressure regulator is there in the system outlet to make sure that the CO2 is remains a single dense phase throughout the chromatograph.
- As a consequence, the detectors (UV or DAD) need to be able to be operated at high temperatures.
- After passing through the detector, the mobile phase is returned to the backpressure regulator in the SFC conversion module
    - there, it is allowed to drop to atmospheric pressure
    - after the pressure is stabilized, the fluid breaks down into two phases
        - liquid goes to trap
        - gas goes into a fume hood.
- state that the SFC conversion module is the only new thing added to the HPLC

## Why should you care (As in, why use SFC and not just LC)?
- remember that LC is preferred over GC when
    - one wants to analyze thermally unstable compounds
    - one wants to analyze non-volatile compounds
- start off with the van Deemter equation
    - draw the equation on the board
        - A is Eddy diffusion
        - B is longitudinal diffusion
        - C is mass transfer
    - state that increased temperature and diffusion coefficient increases the B term, while increased viscosity decreases it
    - B is neglected in liquid chromatography because the mobile phase velocity is much higher than the diffusion coefficient of the component in solution.
- However, in SFC, the B term is not negligible
    - the intermolecular interactions in gaseous CO2 are weak
    - when it is compressed, the resulting dense fluid acts like a solvent.
    - Yet, the intermolecular forces are still weak, despite the increased density.
    - So, other compounds dissolved in CO2 can diffuse rapidly through it.
    - In addition, the diffusion coefficient of CO2 is extremely high.
    - As a consequence, SFC is like three to five times faster than HPLC, and run times are shorter.
    - Also, re-equilibration is faster
- Other advantages:
    - Lower operating costs, as CO2 is cheap
    - Environmentally friendly

## Applications, including one detailed description, if you can
- As a general rule, any compound soluble in methanol or a less polar solvent is a good candidate for separation by SFC.
- commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to separate chiral compounds
- usually, normal phase HPLC is used to separate chiral compounds as they rely on mostly polar-polar interactions, and can better differentiate small differences in shape.
- RP-HPLC relies on different hydrophobic interactions to separate compounds.
- Most drugs are chiral, meaning they have pairs of isomers that are mirror images of each other called enantiomers.
- SFC is more superior in separating chiral compounds than NP-HPLC, in terms of speed and resolution.

## A Summary
- SFC is a good alternative for HPLC.
