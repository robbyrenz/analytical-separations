# **Detectors**
- Know how they work
- It's features
- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Know that the type of analyte impacts your choice of detector

## GC Detectors
1. FID (flame ionization detector)
2. TCD (thermal conductivity detector)
3. ECD (electron capture detector)
4. NPD (thermionic or nitrogen-phosphorous; this is mass-sensitive)
5. FPD (flame photometric; this is mass-sensitive)
6. AED (atomic emission; this is mass-sensitive)
7. IRD (infrared)
8. MSD (mass spectrometric)

## How GC detectors work in general?
- detect changes in the composition of column effluent
- convert that info into a signal

## How to compare responses of different detectors?
- By checking its characteristics, namely:
	- Sensitivity
	- Limit of detection (LOD)
	- (linear) dynamic range (LDR)
	- Selectivity (either universal or highly selective)

## ***FID (Flame Ionization Detector)***

### How they work?
- The column effluent is mixed with hydrogen and air
- This effluent is burned with the help of a flame tip (jet tip)
- This inert carrier gas produces very little ionization, so it has a small baseline signal
- Most organic compounds produce ions & electrons
- This conducts electricity through the flame with the help of chemionization (chemical ionization)
	- Note that the temperature of flame is too low for thermal ionization
	- Carbon atoms (except C double-bonded O & COO) produce reaction of HC radicals 
	- (reaction happens here which produces electrons)
	- Current is produced by applying voltage between the jet tip and the collector electrode (positive electrode)
	- So cations migrate to cathode to produce a signal
	- Signal is magnified to produce a peak


### **Features and Advantages**
- Wide linear dynamic range (~10^7)
- Very sensitive

### **Disadvantages**

### **Great detector for?**
- Hydrocarbons, like PAHs
