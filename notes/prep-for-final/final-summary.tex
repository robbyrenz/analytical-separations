\section{High Performance Liquid Chromatography}

\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item HPLC stands for "High Performance Liquid Chromatography" or "High Pressure Liquid Chromatography"
	\item \textbf{Advantages}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analysis of thermally unstable compounds
		\item Analysis of nonvolatile compounds
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Major requirement of LC}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solute solubility in mobile phase
		\item This is in contrast to GC which require solute volatility
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scope of HPLC}
\begin{description}
	\item[Adsorption chromatography (LSC)]
	\item[Ion chromatography (IC)]
	\item[Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)]
	\item[Partition chromatography] separation of analytes by partitioning, most commonly to a stationary phase bonded to a solid support \\ Note that this replaces liquid-liquid chromatography with its problems of stripping of stationary phase
	\item[Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)] for separation of proteins without denaturation
	\item[Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)] for separation of very polar analytes
	\item[Chiral chromatography]
	\item[Affinity chromatography]
\end{description}


\subsection{Column Efficiency in HPLC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recall the van Deemter equation for GLC (commonly called GC) for packed columns:
	\begin{equation}
		H = A + \frac{B}{u} + Cu
	\end{equation}
	\item For longitudinal diffusion in LC, as the $D_l \approx 10^{-5}D_g$, the peak broadening due to longitudinal diffusion in mobile phase (liquid) phase in LC is \textit{negligible}.
	\item i.e., $\frac{B}{u} = \frac{2\gamma{}D_m}{u}$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Pumps}

\begin{description}
	\item[High Pressure Pumps] required to force liquid through a densely packed column at constant flow rate, so that $t_r$ is reproducible.
\end{description} 

Requirements of a pump:

\begin{itemize}
	\item output pressure all the way to 6000 psi, without any leaks; for UHPLC, the pressure is typically $\approx$ \SI{18000}{psi}
	\item have variable flow rates, from \SIrange{0.1}{10}{mL/min}; for UHPLC, the pressure can go all the way down to \SI{0.01}{mL/min}
	\item have a pulse-free output
	\item have a reproducible flow rate (ours to \SI{+-0.3}{\%})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reciprocating Pumps}
These are the most common today, replacing pneumatic and displacement (syringe) pumps.

A single piston reciprocating pump:

\begin{itemize}
	\item an eccentric (off-center) can drives a piston back and forth
	\item its motion is synchronized with operation of check valves which control direction of flow
	\item Fill stroke: piston cavity fills, drawing solvent through the inlet check valve via suction; the outlet valve is closed
	\item delivery stroke: mobile phase forced through column as inlet check valve closes and the outlet valve opens. Pulsed flow produces baseline noise that must be damped
	\item electronic pulse compensation: speeds up piston during refill cycle, reducing the time the piston is not delivering solvent ($\approx$ \SI{200}{ms}); this reduces the noisy baseline
	\item note that the pulse flow pulsates, but the time-averaged flow rate is constant
	\item the regular pressure surge spikes in the baseline may still be seen at extreme sensitive detector
	\item an elliptical cam minimize pulsations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dual Piston Reciprocating Pumps}

\begin{itemize}
	\item essentially 2 single-piston pumps driven by the same motor
	\item 2 pistons are \ang{180} out of phase, i.e., they are synchronized to provide a continuous flow of mobile phase
	\item when one is in the fill stroke, the other is on deliver stroke
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{HPLC solvents (Mobile Phase)}

Solvents need to be HPLC or of similar high-grade for a stable baseline and to extend the life of the column, 'cause those things are expensive!

\begin{description}
	\item[Filtration] to remove particulate matter
	\item[Degassing] to remove dissolved gases, especially \ce{N2} and \ce{O2}, by vacuum or \ce{He} sparging 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Pressure Drop Across Column (Backpressure)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pressure developed when the liquid mobile phase is pumped through the (packed) HPLC column: 

*enter the equation for backpressure*

	\item therefore, for much larger backpressure occurs with smaller particles, more tightly packed column and a more viscous mobile phase
	\item there is a tradeoff between better performance and higher pressure
\end{itemize}

\section{Important Tips}

\begin{description}
	\item[Isocratic elution] one solvent, or constant solvent mixture.
	\item[Gradient elution] continuous change of solvent composition to increase eluent strength. \\ Gradient elution in HPLC is analoguous to temperature programming in gas chromatography. \\ Increased eluent strength is required to elute more strongly retained solutes.
	\item[General elution problem] for a complex mixture, isocratic conditions can often be found to produce adequate separation of early-eluting peaks or late-eluting peaks, but not both. This problem drives us to use gradient elution.
	\item[Note:] Elution strength decreases as the solvent becomes more polar, correct???
	\item[Separation factor, $\alpha$] Also called relative retention; for two components, 1 and 2, it is the ratio of their adjusted retention times. \\ The greater the relative retention, the greater the separation between two components. \\ Relative retention is fairly independent of flow rate and can therefore be used to to help identify peaks when the flow rate changes. (show equation?)
